We keep calling them “autonomous agents,” but most of what looks like autonomy is careful choreography.

Lately I’ve been experimenting with agentic workflows that “feel” independent. They plan, call tools, hand off to other agents, even self-critique. But the more I push these setups, the more obvious the scaffolding becomes.

Real autonomy isn’t independence — it’s intelligent cooperation.
